This is a fast and dirty mouse simulation for KDE's scripting tool.

It uses xdotool and the keyboard binding tool within KDE.

These scripts map:

M-W - up 40 pixels
M-Shift-W - Up 10 pixels
M-D - right 40 pixels
M-Shift-D - right 10 pixels
... and so on

also

M-Q - right click
M-E - left click

These keybinds DO conflict with some of KDE's default keybinds, be warned!

Made this in about 20 minutes to use with my pok3r so I don't have to reach over my desk and use the mouse.

Enjoy.
